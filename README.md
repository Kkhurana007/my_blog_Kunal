# Personal_blog// Kunal Khurana

It's a 3-in-1 site: it's personal, it has my blog, and it shows my works!

## Features

### Landing Page

The landing consists of posts and links to certain machine learning and data analytics notebooks that could be of some help to someone who wish to study code and do some statistical analysis. This is done through the use of CSS grids and Quarto divs.


### More coming soon

I plan to continue to update my site with more features, especially through the use of Quarto extensions.

## Quarto

This website was created with the open-source [Quarto](https://quarto.org) framework â€” a framework that allows you to create almost any sort of document 
possible from a single markdown file! From websites to presentations to books!

## Reference

This website uses many of Quarto features, and as such, can be used as a reference guide for how to implement such features yourself. Check the URL of the page, to know more!

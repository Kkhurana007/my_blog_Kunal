I am a soil physicist broadly trained in agronomy, soil fertility, and plant nutrition. As a researcher, I seek answers to the fundamental questions about agricultural water management and soil health amelioration in the different (agro)ecosystems. My specific research interests include studying and improving available crop water and nutrient (carbon, nitrogen, etc.) uptake efficiency using machine learning tools. Further, these interests could help to smartly plan the experimental design keeping in mind the changing climate.

Iâ€™m happy to connect with professionals having similar research interests.

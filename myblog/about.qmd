As a broadly trained soil physicist with expertise in agronomy, soil fertility, and plant nutrition, my research interests center around investigating fundamental questions related to agricultural water management and soil health amelioration in diverse agroecosystems. Through the application of cutting-edge machine learning tools, I am dedicated to studying and enhancing crop water and nutrient uptake efficiency, with a specific focus on carbon and nitrogen uptake. My research endeavors also involve developing smart experimental designs that are adaptable to changing climatic conditions. Overall, I aim to advance our understanding of sustainable agriculture and contribute to the development of innovative solutions for optimizing crop production while preserving the health of our soil and ecosystems.
